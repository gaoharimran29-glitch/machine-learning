## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Definition**: The broad field of creating machines that can think, reason, and act like humans.
- AI focuses on building systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

**Examples:**
- Siri or Alexa → Understand and respond to voice commands.
- Google Translate → Convert text from one language to another.
- Self-driving cars → Make driving decisions automatically.

**AI is the umbrella term**. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are subsets of AI.

## Machine Learning (ML)
- **Definition**: A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from **data** without being explicitly programmed.
- The model improves its performance over time as it is exposed to more data.

**Examples:**
- Spam email detection → Classifies emails as spam or not spam.
- Netflix/YouTube recommendations → Suggests movies/videos based on your past viewing.
- Predicting house prices → Based on size, location, and features.

## Deep Learning (DL)
- **Definition**: A specialized subset of ML that uses **Artificial Neural Networks** (ANNs), inspired by the human brain.
- Capable of handling **large and complex data** such as images, audio, video, and text.

**Examples:**
- Facebook photo tagging → Recognizing faces automatically.
- Tesla Autopilot → Processing real-time camera and sensor data.
- ChatGPT / Google Bard → Large language models based on Transformers.

**Difference**:
- ML → Needs feature engineering (manual data preparation).
- DL → Learns features automatically from raw data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### A. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Training the model with both **input data (X)** and the correct **output labels (Y)**.
- The model learns the mapping from input → output.

**Examples:**
- Predicting house price (input = size, location, output = price).
- Classifying email (input = text, output = spam / not spam).

**Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM.

---

### B. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Training the model only with **input data** (no labels).
- The model tries to discover hidden patterns or groupings in the data.

**Examples:**
- Customer segmentation (grouping similar customers by shopping behavior).
- Market basket analysis (finding items often bought together).

**Algorithms**: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA.

---

### C. Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: An **agent** interacts with an **environment**, takes actions, and learns by receiving **rewards** or **penalties**.
- The goal is to maximize total reward over time.

**Examples:**
- Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo → Learned to play Go better than humans.
- Self-driving car → Reward for staying in lane, penalty for crashing.
- Robotics → Reward when walking correctly, penalty when falling.

**Algorithms**: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient.
